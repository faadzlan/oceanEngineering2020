We investigated the amplitude and frequency responses of a circular cylinder - strip plate cruciform system in the Reynolds number range $1.1\times10^{3}<Re<14.6\times10^{3}$ numerically using the open source C++ library: OpenFOAM. We decomposed the cylinder displacement and lift time series from our numerical results into Hilbert transform-friendly signals using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method. The mean phase lag obtained through Hilbert transform points to the existence of an initial branch-like state, with a phase lag of $\approx20$ deg. in the narrow region of $\ured$ close to 18.2. Then, the mean phase lag jumps from $\approx20$ deg. to $\approx110$ deg. once $\ured$ reaches 20.5, analogous to the transition to upper branch in a KVIV amplitude response curve. The instantaneous phase lag shows that SVIV is quasi-periodic up until $\ured = 27.3$. Between $18.2<\ured<22.5$, Karman vortex shedding contributes nearly as much as streamwise vortex shedding to the \rms{} amplitude of total lift, while between $25.0\leq\ured\leq29.5$, the Karman component contribution is on average twice that of the streamwise component. These findings hint at the possibility to improve the power output of the harvester by a factor of two between $18.28<\ured<22.5$ and by a factor of three between $25.0 \leq \ured \leq 29.5$, if we can unite the contribution to the \rms{} amplitude of the total lift under a single vibration-driving mechanism: the shedding of streamwise vortex.

  In recent years, the amplitude/frequency responses of an elastically supported circular cylinder-strip plate cruciform have been shown to produce high-amplitude vibrations over a large range of reduced velocities, compared to an isolated circular cylinder. These vibrations are the result of streamwise vortex shedding and are hence in this study, referred to as the streamwise vortex-induced vibration (SVIV). They are commonly studied to exploit their energy harvesting potential. However, amplitude/frequency responses, and the equally important magnitude of lift, are generally presented as a single variable function of quantities that describe flow velocities, such as Reynolds number (Re) or reduced velocity $\ured$. Despite its utility, this has a side effect of detaching our understanding of the temporal evolution of cylinder displacement and lift from the representative values at each flow velocity. We find such studies scarce and therefore decided to investigate the amplitude and frequency responses of the said cruciform system in the Reynolds number range $1.1\times10^{3}<Re<14.6\times10^{3}$ experimentally in an open water channel and numerically using the open source C++ library: OpenFOAM. We decompose the cylinder displacement and lift force time series from our numerical results into Hilbert transform-friendly monotonic functions using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method. The amplitude/frequency responses suggest the presence of two vibration regimes: the Karman vortex-driven regime when $\ured<18.2$. The mean phase lag obtained through Hilbert transform points to the existence of an ``initial branch''-like state, with a phase lag of $\approx20$ deg. for the streamwise vortex-induced vibration (SVIV) in a narrow region of $\ured$ close to 18.2. Then, the mean phase lag jumps from $\approx20$ deg. to $\approx110$ deg. once $\ured\geq 20.5$, implying transition to some state akin to the ``upper branch'' of SVIV. The temporal evolution of the instantaneous phase lag shows that SVIV is quasi-periodic up until $\ured = 27.3$. The instantaneous frequency spectrum of lift indicates that Karman vortex shedding continues to leave its trace on the total lift even after the onset of SVIV. Honing into the contribution to the total lift by te Karman and streamwise components of lift reveals that both components possess comparable magnitude between $18.2\leq\ured\leq22.7$, while between $25.0\leq\ured\leq29.5$, the Karman component contribution is on average twice that of the streamwise component, the power generated by the system can potentially increase by a factor of 2 berween $18<\ured<23$, and by a factor of 3 when $23<\ured<30$.
